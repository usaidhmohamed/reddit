## Overview
This repo contains a React implementation of Reddit-like comments.

### Install and Run
From root dir
``` bash
npm install
cd .\jsonMockApi\
npm install
```
we use jsonMockApi as mockapi to up that from jsonMockApi folder run
``` bash
npm start # jsonMockApi to up
```
and then from root directory
``` bash
npm start # for developer mode, or
npm run build # for production
```

### Additional Comments
Facebook's Create-React-App was chosen as a starter kit because, in addition to Webpack and Babel, it includes important libraries I use during development like ESLint.
